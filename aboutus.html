    <h1><font color = "DC381F"><u>Divyansh Bansal:</u></font></h1>
    <p><h3>Hello there, I am Divyansh Bansal, a 13 years old student. I have a elder sister who is in grade 12th. My hobbies are
      building websites and playing Lawn Tennis. In the beginning, I was learning Python but then I thought why not learn html and create a website and use my python skills for back end 
      development of the website. I was inspired by children of my age building apps and web pages. I had intrest in computer since I was eight years old. My favourite games 
      are Fortnite, Rocket League and Apex Legends. I usually do not play games but if I want to, during my vacations, I would definitely choose one of these.</h3></p>
